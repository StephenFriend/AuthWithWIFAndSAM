# Auth with WIF & SAM 
A simple example app demonstrating how to use .Net 4.5 and the Windows Identity Foundation's Session Authentication Module to replace Forms Authentication in an MVC app.

There will be a blog post at http://stevefriend.blogspot.co.uk/ which goes with this code, explaining what it's all about.  There are tagged commits so that people can walk through the changes to the code easily, showing how Forms Authentication is replaced by SAM.
